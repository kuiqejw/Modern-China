# Modern-China
Pang 2.0: SUTD
* Want slides? Not here. Just look at the notes in .onepkg and .pdf titled "Modern China" 
* The Final exam was : write a letter to your good comrade as a member of the CCCP in the midst of the Tiananmen protests. OR write an article about the overseas Chinese and their potential. 
* Guess which one I did. 
* Same thing for Pang's stuff: Mid Term Essay * 2 + Final Exam. 
* Book review for the second essay. 
* Seriously, go take his class!
* I'm not uploading the syllabus here.
